# renamer

Simple solution made to rename files, folders and text within the file recursively.

It's a simple (and ugly) WPF which just iterates through the folders and files and applies the change.

_If you are looking for a well made project, following principles, this is *not* your project_ :)
_If you are just looking for quick way to rename recursively in Windows, this might help_


Soon I will try to change it for dotnetcore. So it can be cross platform. :)
